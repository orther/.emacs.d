* :ui doom-modeline

This module customizes the Emacs mode-line.

The DOOM modeline was designed for minimalism, and offers:

+ A match count panel (for ~evil-search~, ~iedit~ and ~evil-substitute~)
+ An indicator for recording a macro
+ Local python/ruby version in the major-mode
+ A customizable mode-line height (see ~+doom-modeline-height~)
+ An error/warning count segment for flycheck

** Install
This module requires the fonts included with ~all-the-icons~ to be installed.

Run ~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~ to do so.

** Extracting my modeline
Some might want my modeline without the DOOM config altogether. I've taken some care to make this as easier for you.

Here is what you must do:

+ Ensure [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]] and [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]] are installed
+ Ensure ~projectile-mode~ is enabled
+ Ensure the fonts included with ~all-the-icons~ are installed (~M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts~)
+ Replace ~def-package!~ calls with ~use-package~
+ Replace ~doom-project-root~ calls with ~projectile-project-root~

And you /should/ be good to go. As I have never used this out of my config I can't guarantee immediate success, but I'd be happy to help you out. File an issue.

** Troubleshooting
*** Where are my minor-modes?
I didn't need it, so I removed it. I wrote ~doom/what-minor-mode~ in the rare case I needed to investigate the currently active minor modes however.

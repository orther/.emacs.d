It is a story as old as time. A stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic
vimmer -- envious of the features of modern text editors -- spirals into despair
before he finally succumbs to the [dark side][evil-mode]. This is his config.

DOOM's philosophy is simple: be **fast**, be **readable**, and be **pretty**. It
is tailored for neckbeards with a blue-belt or better in command-line-fu who
don't shy away from dabbling with Elisp.

Rip and tear. Until it compiles.

> **Important:** Doom only supports Emacs >= 25.1, and is tailored for Arch
> Linux 4.7+ and Mac OS 10.11+.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
cp init.example.el init.el  # maybe edit init.el
make install
```

Visit the wiki for [a more detailed guide on installing, customizing and
grokking Doom][wiki].

## Feature highlights

+ A fast, organized and opinionated Emacs configuration with a command line
  interface.
+ A custom, declarative [package management system][doom-packages] that combines
  package.el, [use-package] and [quelpa]. This lets you install packages from
  sources other than ELPA, as well as manage packages from the command line.
+ A [popup management system][doom-popups] (powered by [shackle]) that minimizes
  the presence and footprint of temporary and/or disposable buffers.
+ A vim-like experience with [evil-mode], including ports for several vim
  plugins, <kbd>C-x</kbd> omnicompletion and a slew of [custom ex commands][doom-my-commands].
+ Integration with [editorconfig]. Let someone else argue about tabs and spaces
  (spaces, duh).
+ Code completion for a variety of languages, powered by [company-mode] (there
  may be other dependencies for certain languages).
+ Project-awareness powered by [projectile], with tools to navigate and manage
  projects and project files.
+ Fast project search (and replace) utilities, powered by [the_silver_searcher],
  [ripgrep] and [wgrep], with [ivy] (the default), [helm] and ido integration.
+ Isolated and persistent workspaces powered by [persp-mode]. This can
  substitute for vim tabs.
+ Inline/live code evaluation (using [quickrun]), including REPLs for a variety
  of languages.

## Troubleshooting

Found a problem? Here are some things to try:

+ Make sure all plugins are installed with `make install`.
+ A `void-function` or `void-variable` might signal an out-of-date autoloads
  file. Update it with `make autoloads`.
+ Diagnose common OS/environment issues that could interfere with Emacs with
  `make doctor`.
+ If you byte-compiled Doom, run `make clean` or `M-x doom/clean-compiled-files`
  and restart Emacs. Never debug byte-compiled code, it will interfere with your
  efforts in subtle (and not-so-subtle) ways.
+ Check [the FAQ][wiki-troubleshooting] to see if your issue is mentioned.
+ If your issue is associated with a particular module, like code-completion,
  check the module's README.org, if any.

If all else fails, [file a bug report][doom-new-issue].

## Contribute

Doom (and my Emacs work in general) is a labor of love and incurable madness,
done on my free time. It wasn't intended for public use, but I enjoy making Doom
a resource for others.

If you'd like to support my efforts, I welcome contributions of any kind:

+ I love pull requests and bug reports, and elisp pointers are especially
  welcome. Seriously, don't hesitate to [tell me my Elisp-fu
  sucks][doom-new-issue]!
+ I'm happy to discuss Emacs workflow, ideas or tooling. If you think I, Doom or
  other Emacs users could benefit from them (or you just want to chat), drop me
  a line at henrik@lissner.net. I'm eager to learn.
